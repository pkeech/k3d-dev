K3D Development Environment
</h1>

### Project Description

This project was created to demostrate how to use a local K3D cluster for development purposes. 

### What is K3D?

K3D is a lightweight wrapper to run K3S (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

K3D makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node K3S clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.
