K3D Development Environment

## Project Description

This project was created to demostrate how to use a local K3d cluster for development purposes. 

## What is K3D?

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.
